# Visualization of Functional Enrichment Result {#chapter12}



The `r Biocpkg("enrichplot")` package implements several visualization methods
to help interpreting enrichment results. It supports visualizing enrichment
results obtained from `r Biocpkg("DOSE")` [@yu_dose_2015],
`r Biocpkg("clusterProfiler")` [@yu_2012],
`r Biocpkg("ReactomePA")` [@yu_reactomepa_2016] and `r Biocpkg("meshes")`. Both
over representation analysis (ORA) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) are
supported.

Many of these visualization methods were first implemented in `r Biocpkg("DOSE")` and rewrote from scratch using `ggplot2`. If you want to use old methods^[<https://www.biostars.org/p/375555>], you can use the [doseplot](https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/doseplot) package.

## Bar Plot


Bar plot is the most widely used method to visualize enriched terms. It depicts
the enrichment scores (*e.g.* p values) and gene count or ratio as bar height
and color.

```{r fig.width=12, fig.height=8}
library(DOSE)
data(geneList)
de <- names(geneList)[abs(geneList) > 2]

edo <- enrichDGN(de)
```

```{r fig.height=5, fig.width=8}
library(enrichplot)
barplot(edo, showCategory=20)
```


## Dot plot


Dot plot is similar to bar plot with the capability to encode another score as
dot size.

```{r fig.width=12, fig.height=8}
edo2 <- gseNCG(geneList, nPerm=10000)
p1 <- dotplot(edo, showCategory=30) + ggtitle("dotplot for ORA")
p2 <- dotplot(edo2, showCategory=30) + ggtitle("dotplot for GSEA")
plot_grid(p1, p2, ncol=2)
```



## Gene-Concept Network

Both the `barplot` and `dotplot` only displayed most significant enriched terms,
while users may want to know which genes are involved in these significant
terms. 
In order to consider the potentially biological complexities in which a gene may belong to multiple annotation categories and provide information of numeric changes if available, we developed `cnetplot` function to extract the complex association. 
The `cnetplot` depicts the linkages of genes and biological concepts (*e.g.* GO terms or KEGG pathways) as a network. GSEA result is also supported
with only core enriched genes displayed.

```{r fig.width=12, fig.height=8}
## convert gene ID to Symbol
edox <- setReadable(edo, 'org.Hs.eg.db', 'ENTREZID')
cnetplot(edox, foldChange=geneList)
## categorySize can be scaled by 'pvalue' or 'geneNum'
cnetplot(edox, categorySize="pvalue", foldChange=geneList)
cnetplot(edox, foldChange=geneList, circular = TRUE, colorEdge = TRUE)
```


## Heatmap-like functional classification


The `heatplot` is similar to `cnetplot`, while displaying the relationships as a
heatmap. The gene-concept network may become too complicated if user want to
show a large number significant terms. The `heatplot` can simplify the result
and more easy to identify expression patterns.

```{r fig.width=16, fig.height=4}
heatplot(edox)
heatplot(edox, foldChange=geneList)
```



## Enrichment Map


Enrichment map organizes enriched terms into a network with edges connecting
overlapping gene sets. In this way, mutually overlapping gene sets are tend to
cluster together, making it easy to identify functional module.

The `emapplot` function supports results obtained from hypergeometric test and gene set enrichment analysis.
```{r fig.width=12, fig.height=10}
emapplot(edo)
```



## UpSet Plot


The `upsetplot` is an alternative to `cnetplot` for visualizing the complex
association between genes and gene sets. It emphasizes the gene overlapping
among different gene sets.

```{r fig.width=12, fig.height=5}
upsetplot(edo)
```


## ridgeline plot for expression distribution of GSEA result

The `ridgeplot` will visualize expression distributions of core enriched genes
for GSEA enriched categories. It helps users to interpret up/down-regulated pathways.

```{r fig.width=12, fig.height=8, message=FALSE}
ridgeplot(edo2)
```


## running score and preranked list of GSEA result

Running score and preranked list are traditional methods for visualizing GSEA
result. The `r Biocpkg("enrichplot")` package supports both of them to visualize
the distribution of the gene set and the enrichment score.


```{r fig.width=12, fig.height=4}
gseaplot(edo2, geneSetID = 1, by = "runningScore", title = edo2$Description[1])
gseaplot(edo2, geneSetID = 1, by = "preranked", title = edo2$Description[1])
```

```{r fig.width=12, fig.height=8}
gseaplot(edo2, geneSetID = 1, title = edo2$Description[1])
```

Another method to plot GSEA result is the `gseaplot2` function:

```{r fig.width=12, fig.height=8}
gseaplot2(edo2, geneSetID = 1, title = edo2$Description[1])
```

The `gseaplot2` also supports multile gene sets to be displayed on the same figure:

```{r fig.width=12, fig.height=8}
gseaplot2(edo2, geneSetID = 1:3)
```

User can also displaying the pvalue table on the plot via `pvalue_table`
parameter:

```{r fig.width=12, fig.height=8}
gseaplot2(edo2, geneSetID = 1:3, pvalue_table = TRUE,
          color = c("#E495A5", "#86B875", "#7DB0DD"), ES_geom = "dot")
```


User can specify `subplots` to only display a subset of plots:

```{r fig.width=12, fig.height=4}
gseaplot2(edo2, geneSetID = 1:3, subplots = 1)
```

```{r fig.width=12, fig.height=8}
gseaplot2(edo2, geneSetID = 1:3, subplots = 1:2)
```


The `gsearank` function plot the ranked list of genes belong to the specific
gene set.

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=4}
gsearank(edo2, 1, title = edo2[1, "Description"])
```

Multiple gene sets can be aligned using `cowplot`:

```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
library(ggplot2)
library(cowplot)

pp <- lapply(1:3, function(i) {
    anno <- edo2[i, c("NES", "pvalue", "p.adjust")]
    lab <- paste0(names(anno), "=",  round(anno, 3), collapse="\n")

    gsearank(edo2, i, edo2[i, 2]) + xlab(NULL) +ylab(NULL) +
        annotate("text", 0, edo2[i, "enrichmentScore"] * .9, label = lab, hjust=0, vjust=0)
})
plot_grid(plotlist=pp, ncol=1)
```



## pubmed trend of enriched terms

One of the problem of enrichment analysis is to find pathways for further
investigation. Here, we provide `pmcplot` function to plot the number/proportion
of publications trend based on the query result from PubMed Central. Of course,
users can use `pmcplot` in other scenarios. All text that can be queried on PMC
is valid as input of `pmcplot`.


```{r fig.width=12, fig.height=4}
terms <- edo$Description[1:3]
p <- pmcplot(terms, 2010:2017)
p2 <- pmcplot(terms, 2010:2017, proportion=FALSE)
plot_grid(p, p2, ncol=2)
```


## goplot

`goplot` can accept output of `enrichGO` and visualized the enriched GO induced graph.

```{r fig.height=12, fig.width=8, eval=FALSE}
goplot(ego)
```


## browseKEGG

To view the KEGG pathway, user can use `browseKEGG` function, which will open web browser and highlight enriched genes.

```{r eval=FALSE}
browseKEGG(kk, 'hsa04110')
```

## pathview from pathview package

[clusterProfiler](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/clusterProfiler) users can also use `pathview` from the [pathview](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/pathview)[@luo_pathview] to visualize KEGG pathway.

The following example illustrate how to visualize "hsa04110" pathway, which was enriched in our previous analysis.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library("pathview")
hsa04110 <- pathview(gene.data  = geneList,
                     pathway.id = "hsa04110",
                     species    = "hsa",
                     limit      = list(gene=max(abs(geneList)), cpd=1))
```
