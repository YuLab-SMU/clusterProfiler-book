A pathway can be interpreted as a gene set by ignoring functional relationships among genes. 1.1.2 Gene Ontology (GO) Gene Ontology defines concepts/classes used to describe gene function, and relationships between these concepts. It classifies functions along three aspects: MF: Molecular Function molecular activities of gene products CC: Cellular Component where gene products are active BP: Biological Process pathways and larger processes made up of the activities of multiple gene products GO terms are organized in a directed acyclic graph, where edge between the terms represent parent-child relationship. 1.1.3 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) KEGG is a collection of manually drawn pathway maps representing molecular interaction and reaction networks. These pathways cover a wide range of biochemical processes that can be divided in 7 broad categories: metabolism, genetic and environmental information processing, cellular processes, organismal systems, human diseases, and drug development1. 1.1.4 Other gene sets GO and KEGG are most frequently used for the functional analysis. They are typically the first choice because their long-standing curation and availability for a wide range of species. Other gene sets including but not limited to Disease Ontology (DO), Disease Gene Network (DisGeNET), wikiPathways, Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDb). https://pathview.uncc.edu/data/khier.tsv↩︎ "],
["chapter2.html", "Chapter 2 Functional Enrichment Analysis Methods 2.1 Over Representation Analysis 2.2 Gene Set Enrichment Analysis 2.3 Leading edge analysis and core enriched genes", " Chapter 2 Functional Enrichment Analysis Methods 2.1 Over Representation Analysis Over Representation Analysis (ORA) (Boyle et al. 2004) is a widely used approach to determine whether known biological functions or processes are over-represented (= enriched) in an experimentally-derived gene list, e.g. a list of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The p-value can be calculated by hypergeometric distribution. \\(p = 1 - \\displaystyle\\sum_{i = 0}^{k-1}\\frac{{M \\choose i}{{N-M} \\choose {n-i}}} {{N \\choose n}}\\) In this equation, N is the total number of genes in the background distribution, M is the number of genes within that distribution that are annotated (either directly or indirectly) to the gene set of interest, n is the size of the list of genes of interest and k is the number of genes within that list which are annotated to the gene set. The background distribution by default is all the genes that have annotation. P-values should be adjusted for multiple comparison. Example: Suppose we have 17,980 genes detected in a Microarray study and 57 genes were differentially expressed. Among the differential expressed genes, 28 are annotated to a gene set2. d &lt;- data.frame(gene.not.interest=c(2613, 15310), gene.in.interest=c(28, 29)) row.names(d) &lt;- c(&quot;In_category&quot;, &quot;not_in_category&quot;) d ## gene.not.interest gene.in.interest ## In_category 2613 28 ## not_in_category 15310 29 whether the overlap of 25 genes are significantly over represented in the gene set can be assessed using hypergeometric distribution. This corresponding to a one-sided version of Fisher’s exact test. fisher.test(d, alternative = &quot;greater&quot;) ## ## Fisher&#39;s Exact Test for Count Data ## ## data: d ## p-value = 1 ## alternative hypothesis: true odds ratio is greater than 1 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.110242 Inf ## sample estimates: ## odds ratio ## 0.1767937 2.2 Gene Set Enrichment Analysis A common approach in analyzing gene expression profiles was identifying differential expressed genes that are deemed interesting. The enrichment analysis we demonstrated in Disease enrichment analysis vignette were based on these differential expressed genes. This approach will find genes where the difference is large, but it will not detect a situation where the difference is small, but evidenced in coordinated way in a set of related genes. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)(Subramanian et al. 2005) directly addresses this limitation. All genes can be used in GSEA; GSEA aggregates the per gene statistics across genes within a gene set, therefore making it possible to detect situations where all genes in a predefined set change in a small but coordinated way. Since it is likely that many relevant phenotypic differences are manifested by small but consistent changes in a set of genes. Genes are ranked based on their phenotypes. Given a priori defined set of gene S (e.g., genes shareing the same DO category), the goal of GSEA is to determine whether the members of S are randomly distributed throughout the ranked gene list (L) or primarily found at the top or bottom. There are three key elements of the GSEA method: Calculation of an Enrichment Score. The enrichment score (ES) represent the degree to which a set S is over-represented at the top or bottom of the ranked list L. The score is calculated by walking down the list L, increasing a running-sum statistic when we encounter a gene in S and decreasing when it is not. The magnitude of the increment depends on the gene statistics (e.g., correlation of the gene with phenotype). The ES is the maximum deviation from zero encountered in the random walk; it corresponds to a weighted Kolmogorov-Smirnov-like statistic(Subramanian et al. 2005). Esimation of Significance Level of ES. The p-value of the ES is calculated using permutation test. Specifically, we permute the gene labels of the gene list L and recompute the ES of the gene set for the permutated data, which generate a null distribution for the ES. The p-value of the observed ES is then calculated relative to this null distribution. Adjustment for Multiple Hypothesis Testing. When the entire gene sets were evaluated, DOSE adjust the estimated significance level to account for multiple hypothesis testing and also q-values were calculated for FDR control. We implemented GSEA algorithm proposed by Subramanian(Subramanian et al. 2005). Alexey Sergushichev implemented an algorithm for fast GSEA analysis in the fgsea(S., n.d.) package. In DOSE(Yu et al. 2015), user can use GSEA algorithm implemented in DOSE or fgsea by specifying the parameter by=\"DOSE\" or by=\"fgsea\". By default, DOSE use fgsea since it is much more fast. 2.3 Leading edge analysis and core enriched genes Leading edge analysis reports Tags to indicate the percentage of genes contributing to the enrichment score, List to indicate where in the list the enrichment score is attained and Signal for enrichment signal strength. It would also be very interesting to get the core enriched genes that contribute to the enrichment. DOSE supports leading edge analysis and report core enriched genes in GSEA analysis. References "],
["chapter3.html", "Chapter 3 Universal enrichment analysis 3.1 Input data 3.2 WikiPathways analysis 3.3 Cell Marker 3.4 MSigDb analysis", " Chapter 3 Universal enrichment analysis clusterProfiler supports both hypergeometric test and gene set enrichment analyses of many ontology/pathway, but it’s still not enough for users may want to analyze their data with unsupported organisms, slim version of GO, novel functional annotation (e.g. GO via BlastGO or KEGG via KAAS), unsupported ontologies/pathways or customized annotations. clusterProfiler provides enricher function for hypergeometric test and GSEA function for gene set enrichment analysis that are designed to accept user defined annotation. They accept two additional parameters TERM2GENE and TERM2NAME. As indicated in the parameter names, TERM2GENE is a data.frame with first column of term ID and second column of corresponding mapped gene and TERM2NAME is a data.frame with first column of term ID and second column of corresponding term name. TERM2NAME is optional. 3.1 Input data For over representation analysis, all we need is a gene vector, that is a vector of gene IDs. These gene IDs can be obtained by differential expression analysis (e.g. with DESeq2 package). For gene set enrichment analysis, we need a ranked list of genes. DOSE provides an example dataset geneList which was derived from R package breastCancerMAINZ that contained 200 samples, including 29 samples in grade I, 136 samples in grade II and 35 samples in grade III. We computed the ratios of geometric means of grade III samples versus geometric means of grade I samples. Logarithm of these ratios (base 2) were stored in geneList dataset. The geneList contains three features: numeric vector: fold change or other type of numerical variable named vector: every number was named by the corresponding gene ID sorted vector: number should be sorted in decreasing order Suppose you are importing your own data from a csv file and the file contains two columns, one for gene ID (no duplicated allowed) and another one for fold change, you can prepare your own geneList via the following command: d &lt;- read.csv(your_csv_file) ## assume that 1st column is ID ## 2nd column is fold change ## feature 1: numeric vector geneList &lt;- d[,2] ## feature 2: named vector names(geneList) &lt;- as.character(d[,1]) ## feature 3: decreasing order geneList &lt;- sort(geneList, decreasing = TRUE) We can load the sample data into R via: data(geneList, package=&quot;DOSE&quot;) head(geneList) ## 4312 8318 10874 55143 55388 991 ## 4.572613 4.514594 4.418218 4.144075 3.876258 3.677857 Suppose we define fold change greater than 2 as DEGs: gene &lt;- names(geneList)[abs(geneList) &gt; 2] head(gene) ## [1] &quot;4312&quot; &quot;8318&quot; &quot;10874&quot; &quot;55143&quot; &quot;55388&quot; &quot;991&quot; 3.2 WikiPathways analysis WikiPathways is a continuously updated pathway database curated by a community of researchers and pathway enthusiasts.

If user needs to convert other gene ID type to entrezgene ID, we recommend using bitr function provided by clusterProfiler. The ont parameter can be “DO” or “DOLite”, DOLite(Du et al. 2009) was constructed to aggregate the redundant DO terms. The DOLite data is not updated, we recommend user use ont=\"DO\". pvalueCutoff setting the cutoff value of p value and p value adjust; pAdjustMethod setting the p value correction methods, include the Bonferroni correction (“bonferroni”), Holm (“holm”), Hochberg (“hochberg”), Hommel (“hommel”), Benjamini &amp; Hochberg (“BH”) and Benjamini &amp; Yekutieli (“BY”) while qvalueCutoff is used to control q-values. The universe setting the background gene universe for testing. If user do not explicitly setting this parameter, enrichDO will set the universe to all human genes that have DO annotation. The minGSSize (and maxGSSize) indicates that only those DO terms that have more than minGSSize (and less than maxGSSize) genes annotated will be tested. The readable is a logical parameter, indicates whether the entrezgene IDs will mapping to gene symbols or not. We also implement setReadable function that helps the user to convert entrezgene IDs to gene symbols. x &lt;- setReadable(x, &#39;org.Hs.eg.db&#39;) head(x) ## ID Description ## DOID:170 DOID:170 endocrine gland cancer ## DOID:10283 DOID:10283 prostate cancer ## DOID:3459 DOID:3459 breast carcinoma ## DOID:3856 DOID:3856 male reproductive organ cancer ## DOID:824 DOID:824 periodontitis ## DOID:3905 DOID:3905 lung carcinoma ## GeneRatio BgRatio pvalue p.adjust ## DOID:170 48/331 472/6268 5.662129e-06 0.004784499 ## DOID:10283 40/331 394/6268 3.859157e-05 0.013921739 ## DOID:3459 37/331 357/6268 4.942629e-05 0.013921739 ## DOID:3856 40/331 404/6268 6.821467e-05 0.014410349 ## DOID:824 16/331 109/6268 1.699304e-04 0.018859464 ## DOID:3905 43/331 465/6268 1.749754e-04 0.018859464 ## qvalue ## DOID:170 0.003826407 ## DOID:10283 0.011133923 ## DOID:3459 0.011133923 ## DOID:3856 0.011524689 ## DOID:824 0.015082872 ## DOID:3905 0.015082872 ## geneID ## DOID:170 NMU/TOP2A/CRABP1/RRM2/UBE2C/MSLN/BIRC5/S100P/EZH2/KIF20A/CCNB1/PTTG1/MCM2/CDC25A/PLK1/MMP9/CXCL8/CTSV/NKX2-2/GGH/HMGA1/TFPI2/RAD51/APLP1/CCNE1/PCLAF/MKI67/IKBKB/F3/AKAP12/AGTR1/TGFB3/HTR2B/GSTT1/PLAT/IRS1/DCN/COL4A5/MUC1/CLDN5/IGF1/CEACAM6/SFRP4/PDGFD/BMP4/CCN5/CXCL14/CX3CR1 ## DOID:10283 MMP1/S100A9/S100A8/BCL2A1/CXCL10/BIRC5/S100P/EZH2/MMP12/NUDT1/CCNB1/PLK1/MAGEA3/MMP9/BUB1B/CXCL8/EPHX3/CRISP3/CCL5/MKI67/IKBKB/F3/ALOX15B/GSTT1/IGFBP4/AR/IRS1/MAOA/MUC1/AZGP1/ITGA7/MAK/TFF1/IGF1/SFRP4/VAV3/PDGFD/BMP4/LRP2/AGR2 ## DOID:3459 MMP1/S100A9/S100A8/TOP2A/NEK2/CCNA2/MAD2L1/BIRC5/S100P/AURKA/CCNB1/PTTG1/HPSE/MCM2/PLK1/MMP9/BUB1B/GBP1/CXCL8/ISG15/CCNE1/TNFRSF11A/MKI67/GSTT1/TNFRSF11B/MAOA/MUC1/TFF1/IGF1/CA12/SCGB2A2/ERBB4/FOXA1/SCGB1D2/PIP/PGR/AGR2 ## DOID:3856 MMP1/S100A9/S100A8/BCL2A1/CXCL10/BIRC5/S100P/EZH2/MMP12/NUDT1/CCNB1/PLK1/MAGEA3/MMP9/BUB1B/CXCL8/EPHX3/CRISP3/CCL5/MKI67/IKBKB/F3/ALOX15B/GSTT1/IGFBP4/AR/IRS1/MAOA/MUC1/AZGP1/ITGA7/MAK/TFF1/IGF1/SFRP4/VAV3/PDGFD/BMP4/LRP2/AGR2 ## DOID:824 MMP1/S100A8/CAMP/IL1R2/MMP12/IL12RB2/MMP9/LYZ/CXCL8/CTLA4/CCL5/PROM1/AGTR1/GSTT1/PLAT/TNFRSF11B ## DOID:3905 MMP1/S100A9/FOXM1/CCNB2/S100A8/TOP2A/S100A7/RRM2/CEP55/UBE2C/SLC7A5/MSLN/BIRC5/S100P/GZMB/AURKB/NUDT1/CCNB1/MCM2/KIF14/FOSL1/MMP9/CXCL8/EIF4EBP1/ECT2/TFPI2/TK1/CCNE1/CCL5/PROM1/MKI67/F3/GJA1/GSTT1/IL6ST/MUC1/TGFBR3/AZGP1/IGF1/DUSP4/HLA-DQA1/ACKR1/GRP ## Count ## DOID:170 48 ## DOID:10283 40 ## DOID:3459 37 ## DOID:3856 40 ## DOID:824 16 ## DOID:3905 43 4.2 enrichNCG function Network of Cancer Gene (NCG)(A. et al. 2016) is a manually curated repository of cancer genes.

Bioconductor have already provide OrgDb for about 20 species. User can query OrgDb online by AnnotationHub or build their own by AnnotationForge. An example can be found in the vignette of GOSemSim. If user have GO annotation data (in data.frame format with first column of gene ID and second column of GO ID), they can use enricher() and gseGO() functions to perform over-representation test and gene set enrichment analysis. If genes are annotated by direction annotation, it should also annotated by its ancestor GO nodes (indirect annation). If user only has direct annotation, they can pass their annotation to buildGOmap function, which will infer indirection annotation and generate a data.frame that suitable for both enricher() and gseGO(). 5.2 GO classification In clusterProfiler, groupGO is designed for gene classification based on GO distribution at a specific level.

With dropGO function, user can remove specific GO terms or GO level from results obtained from both enrichGO and compareCluster. 5.3.2 test GO at sepcific level enrichGO doesn’t contain parameter to restrict the test at specific GO level. Instead, we provide a function gofilter to restrict the result at specific GO level. It works with results obtained from both enrichGO and compareCluster. 5.3.3 reduce redundancy of enriched GO terms GO is organized in parent-child structure, thus a parent term can be overlap with a large proportion with all its child terms. This can result in redundant findings. To solve this issue, clusterProfiler implement simplify method to reduce redundant GO terms from the outputs of enrichGO and gseGO. The function internally called GOSemSim (Yu et al. 2010) to calculate semantic similarity among GO terms and remove those highly similar terms by keeping one representative term. An example can be found in the blog post. 5.4 GO Gene Set Enrichment Analysis A common approach in analyzing gene expression profiles was identifying differential expressed genes that are deemed interesting. The enrichment analysis we demonstrated previous were based on these differential expressed genes. This approach will find genes where the difference is large, but it will not detect a situation where the difference is small, but evidenced in coordinated way in a set of related genes. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)(Subramanian et al. 2005) directly addresses this limitation. All genes can be used in GSEA; GSEA aggregates the per gene statistics across genes within a gene set, therefore making it possible to detect situations where all genes in a predefined set change in a small but coordinated way. Since it is likely that many relevant phenotypic differences are manifested by small but consistent changes in a set of genes. For algorithm details, please refer to the vignette of DOSE. ego3 &lt;- gseGO(geneList = geneList, OrgDb = org.Hs.eg.db, ont = &quot;CC&quot;, nPerm = 1000, minGSSize = 100, maxGSSize = 500, pvalueCutoff = 0.05, verbose = FALSE) GSEA use permutation test, user can set nPerm for number of permutations. Only gene Set size in [minGSSize, maxGSSize] will be tested. If you have issues in preparing your own geneList, please refer to the wiki page. 5.5 GO Semantic Similarity Analysis GO semantic similarity can be calculated by GOSemSim(Yu et al. 2010). We can use it to cluster genes/proteins into different clusters based on their functional similarity and can also use it to measure the similarities among GO terms to reduce the redundancy of GO enrichment results. 5.5.1 GO analysis for non-model organisms Both enrichGO and gseGO functions require an OrgDb object as background annotation. For organisms that don’t have OrgDb provided by Bioconductor, users can query one (if available) online via AnnotationHub. If there is no OrgDb available, users can obtain GO annotation from other sources, e.g. from biomaRt or Blast2GO. Then using enricher or GSEA function to analyze, similar to the examples using wikiPathways and MSigDB. Another solution is to create OrgDb by your own using AnnotationForge package. References "],

["chapter10.html", "Chapter 10 Functional enrichment analysis of genomic coordinations", " Chapter 10 Functional enrichment analysis of genomic coordinations Functional analysis using NGS data (eg, RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq) can be performed by linking coding and non-coding regions to coding genes via ChIPseeker(Yu, Wang, and He 2015) package, which can annotates genomic regions to their nearest genes, host genes, and flanking genes respectivly. In addtion, it provides a function, seq2gene, that simultaneously considering host genes, promoter region and flanking gene from intergenic region that may under control via cis-regulation.

User can changes the parameter showCategory to specify how many categories of each cluster to be plotted, and if showCategory was set to NULL, the whole result will be plotted. The plot function accepts a parameter by for setting the scale of dot sizes. The default parameter by is setting to “geneRatio”, which corresponding to the “GeneRatio” column of the output. If it was setting to count, the comparison will be based on gene counts, while if setting to rowPercentage, the dot sizes will be normalized by count/(sum of each row) To provide the full information, we also provide number of identified genes in each category (numbers in parentheses) when by is setting to rowPercentage and number of gene clusters in each cluster label (numbers in parentheses) when by is setting to geneRatio, as shown in Figure 3. If the dot sizes were based on count, the row numbers will not shown. The p-values indicate that which categories are more likely to have biological meanings. The dots in the plot are color-coded based on their corresponding p-values. Color gradient ranging from red to blue correspond to in order of increasing p-values. That is, red indicate low p-values (high enrichment), and blue indicate high p-values (low enrichment). P-values and adjusted p-values were filtered out by the threshold giving by parameter pvalueCutoff, and FDR can be estimated by qvalue. User can refer to the example in Yu (2012)(Yu et al. 2012); we analyzed the publicly available expression dataset of breast tumour tissues from 200 patients (GSE11121, Gene Expression Omnibus)(Schmidt et al. 2008). We identified 8 gene clusters from differentially expressed genes, and using compareCluster to compare these gene clusters by their enriched biological process. The comparison function was designed as a framework for comparing gene clusters of any kind of ontology associations, not only groupGO, enrichGO, enrichKEGG and enricher provided in this package, but also other biological and biomedical ontologies, for instance, enrichDO from DOSE(Yu et al. 2015), enrichMeSH from meshes and enrichPathway from ReactomePA work fine with compareCluster for comparing biological themes in disease and reactome pathway perspective. More details can be found in the vignettes of DOSE(Yu et al. 2015) and ReactomePA. References "],

It supports visualizing enrichment results obtained from DOSE (Yu et al. 2015), clusterProfiler (Yu et al. 2012), ReactomePA (Yu and He 2016) and meshes. Both over representation analysis (ORA) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) are supported. Many of these visualization methods were first implemented in DOSE and rewrote from scratch using ggplot2. If you want to use old methods3, you can use the doseplot package. 12.1 Bar Plot Bar plot is the most widely used method to visualize enriched terms. It depicts the enrichment scores (e.g. p values) and gene count or ratio as bar height and color. library(DOSE) data(geneList) de &lt;- names(geneList)[abs(geneList) &gt; 2] edo &lt;- enrichDGN(de) library(enrichplot) barplot(edo, showCategory=20) Figure 12.1: Bar plot of enriched terms. 12.2 Dot plot Dot plot is similar to bar plot with the capability to encode another score as dot size. edo2 &lt;- gseNCG(geneList, nPerm=10000) p1 &lt;- dotplot(edo, showCategory=30) + ggtitle(&quot;dotplot for ORA&quot;) p2 &lt;- dotplot(edo2, showCategory=30) + ggtitle(&quot;dotplot for GSEA&quot;) plot_grid(p1, p2, ncol=2) Figure 12.2: Dot plot of enriched terms. 12.3 Gene-Concept Network Both the barplot and dotplot only displayed most significant enriched terms, while users may want to know which genes are involved in these significant terms. In order to consider the potentially biological complexities in which a gene may belong to multiple annotation categories and provide information of numeric changes if available, we developed cnetplot function to extract the complex association. The cnetplot depicts the linkages of genes and biological concepts (e.g. GO terms or KEGG pathways) as a network. GSEA result is also supported with only core enriched genes displayed. ## convert gene ID to Symbol edox &lt;- setReadable(edo, &#39;org.Hs.eg.db&#39;, &#39;ENTREZID&#39;) p1 &lt;- cnetplot(edox, foldChange=geneList) ## categorySize can be scaled by &#39;pvalue&#39; or &#39;geneNum&#39; p2 &lt;- cnetplot(edox, categorySize=&quot;pvalue&quot;, foldChange=geneList) p3 &lt;- cnetplot(edox, foldChange=geneList, circular = TRUE, colorEdge = TRUE) cowplot::plot_grid(p1, p2, p3, ncol=3, labels=LETTERS[1:3], rel_widths=c(.8, .8, 1.2)) Figure 12.3: Network plot of enriched terms. If you would like label subset of the nodes, you can use the node_label parameter, which supports 4 possible selections (i.e. “category”, “gene”, “all” and “none”), as demonstrated in Figure 12.4. p1 &lt;- cnetplot(edox, node_label=&quot;category&quot;) p2 &lt;- cnetplot(edox, node_label=&quot;gene&quot;) p3 &lt;- cnetplot(edox, node_label=&quot;all&quot;) p4 &lt;- cnetplot(edox, node_label=&quot;none&quot;) cowplot::plot_grid(p1, p2, p3, p4, ncol=2, labels=LETTERS[1:4]) Figure 12.4: Labelling nodes by selected subset. gene category (A), gene name (B), both gene category and gene name (C, default) and not to label at all (D). 12.4 Heatmap-like functional classification The heatplot is similar to cnetplot, while displaying the relationships as a heatmap. The gene-concept network may become too complicated if user want to show a large number significant terms. The heatplot can simplify the result and more easy to identify expression patterns. p1 &lt;- heatplot(edox) p2 &lt;- heatplot(edox, foldChange=geneList) cowplot::plot_grid(p1, p2, ncol=1, labels=LETTERS[1:2]) Figure 12.5: Heatmap plot of enriched terms. default (A), foldChange=geneList (B) 12.5 Enrichment Map Enrichment map organizes enriched terms into a network with edges connecting overlapping gene sets. In this way, mutually overlapping gene sets are tend to cluster together, making it easy to identify functional module. The emapplot function supports results obtained from hypergeometric test and gene set enrichment analysis. The pie_scale parameter can be used to resize nodes, as demonstrated in Figure 12.6 B, and the layout parameter can adjust the layout, as demonstrated in Figure 12.6 C and D. p1 &lt;- emapplot(edo) p2 &lt;- emapplot(edo, pie_scale=1.5) p3 &lt;- emapplot(edo,layout=&quot;kk&quot;) p4 &lt;- emapplot(edo, pie_scale=1.5,layout=&quot;kk&quot;) cowplot::plot_grid(p1, p2, p3, p4, ncol=2, labels=LETTERS[1:4]) Figure 12.6: Plot for results obtained from hypergeometric test and gene set enrichment analysis. default (A), pie_scale=1.5 (B), layout=\"kk\" (C) and pie_scale=1.5,layout=\"kk\" (D). The emapplot function also supports results obtained from compareCluster function of clusterProfiler package. In addition to pie_scale and layout parameters, the number of circles in the bottom left corner can be adjusted using the legend_n parameteras, as demonstrated in Figure 12.7 B. And proportion of clusters in the pie chart can be adjusted using the pie parameter, when pie=\"count\", the proportion of clusters in the pie chart is determined by the number of genes, as demonstrated in Figure 12.7 C and D. library(clusterProfiler) data(gcSample) xx &lt;- compareCluster(gcSample, fun=&quot;enrichKEGG&quot;, organism=&quot;hsa&quot;, pvalueCutoff=0.05) p1 &lt;- emapplot(xx) p2 &lt;- emapplot(xx,legend_n=2) p3 &lt;- emapplot(xx,pie=&quot;count&quot;) p4 &lt;- emapplot(xx,pie=&quot;count&quot;, pie_scale=1.5, layout=&quot;kk&quot;) cowplot::plot_grid(p1, p2, p3, p4, ncol=2, labels=LETTERS[1:4]) Figure 12.7: Plot for results obtained from compareCluster function of clusterProfiler package. default (A), legend_n=2 (B), pie=\"count\" (C) and pie=\"count\", pie_scale=1.5, layout=\"kk\" (D). 12.6 UpSet Plot The upsetplot is an alternative to cnetplot for visualizing the complex association between genes and gene sets. It emphasizes the gene overlapping among different gene sets. upsetplot(edo) Figure 12.8: Upsetplot for over-representation analysis. For over-representation analysis, upsetplot will calculate the overlaps among different gene sets as demonstrated in Figure 12.8. For GSEA result, it will plot the fold change distributions of different categories (e.g. unique to pathway, overlaps among different pathways). upsetplot(kk2) Figure 12.9: Upsetplot for gene set enrichment analysis. 12.7 ridgeline plot for expression distribution of GSEA result The ridgeplot will visualize expression distributions of core enriched genes for GSEA enriched categories. It helps users to interpret up/down-regulated pathways. ridgeplot(edo2) Figure 12.10: Ridgeplot for gene set enrichment analysis. 12.8 running score and preranked list of GSEA result Running score and preranked list are traditional methods for visualizing GSEA result. The enrichplot package supports both of them to visualize the distribution of the gene set and the enrichment score. p1 &lt;- gseaplot(edo2, geneSetID = 1, by = &quot;runningScore&quot;, title = edo2$Description[1]) p2 &lt;- gseaplot(edo2, geneSetID = 1, by = &quot;preranked&quot;, title = edo2$Description[1]) p3 &lt;- gseaplot(edo2, geneSetID = 1, title = edo2$Description[1]) cowplot::plot_grid(p1, p2, p3, ncol=1, labels=LETTERS[1:3]) Figure 12.11: gseaplot for GSEA result(by = \"runningScore\"). by = \"runningScore\" (A), by = \"preranked\" (B), default (C) Another method to plot GSEA result is the gseaplot2 function: gseaplot2(edo2, geneSetID = 1, title = edo2$Description[1]) Figure 12.12: Gseaplot2 for GSEA result. The gseaplot2 also supports multile gene sets to be displayed on the same figure: gseaplot2(edo2, geneSetID = 1:3) Figure 12.13: Gseaplot2 for GSEA result of multile gene sets. User can also displaying the pvalue table on the plot via pvalue_table parameter: gseaplot2(edo2, geneSetID = 1:3, pvalue_table = TRUE, color = c(&quot;#E495A5&quot;, &quot;#86B875&quot;, &quot;#7DB0DD&quot;), ES_geom = &quot;dot&quot;) Figure 12.14: Gseaplot2 for GSEA result of multile gene sets(add pvalue_table). User can specify subplots to only display a subset of plots: p1 &lt;- gseaplot2(edo2, geneSetID = 1:3, subplots = 1) p2 &lt;- gseaplot2(edo2, geneSetID = 1:3, subplots = 1:2) cowplot::plot_grid(p1, p2, ncol=1, labels=LETTERS[1:2]) Figure 12.15: Gseaplot2 for GSEA result of multile gene sets(add subplots). subplots = 1 (A),subplots = 1:2 (B) The gsearank function plot the ranked list of genes belong to the specific gene set. gsearank(edo2, 1, title = edo2[1, &quot;Description&quot;]) Figure 12.16: Ranked list of genes belong to the specific gene set. Multiple gene sets can be aligned using cowplot: (ref:gsearank2scap) Gsearank for multiple gene sets. library(ggplot2) library(cowplot) pp &lt;- lapply(1:3, function(i) { anno &lt;- edo2[i, c(&quot;NES&quot;, &quot;pvalue&quot;, &quot;p.adjust&quot;)] lab &lt;- paste0(names(anno), &quot;=&quot;, round(anno, 3), collapse=&quot;\\n&quot;) gsearank(edo2, i, edo2[i, 2]) + xlab(NULL) +ylab(NULL) + annotate(&quot;text&quot;, 0, edo2[i, &quot;enrichmentScore&quot;] * .9, label = lab, hjust=0, vjust=0) }) plot_grid(plotlist=pp, ncol=1) Figure 12.17: Gsearank for multiple gene sets. 12.9 pubmed trend of enriched terms One of the problem of enrichment analysis is to find pathways for further investigation. Here, we provide pmcplot function to plot the number/proportion of publications trend based on the query result from PubMed Central. Of course, users can use pmcplot in other scenarios. All text that can be queried on PMC is valid as input of pmcplot. terms &lt;- edo$Description[1:3] p &lt;- pmcplot(terms, 2010:2017) p2 &lt;- pmcplot(terms, 2010:2017, proportion=FALSE) plot_grid(p, p2, ncol=2) Figure 12.18: Pmcplot of enrichment analysis. 12.10 goplot goplot can accept output of enrichGO and visualized the enriched GO induced graph. goplot(ego) 12.11 browseKEGG To view the KEGG pathway, user can use browseKEGG function, which will open web browser and highlight enriched genes. browseKEGG(kk, &#39;hsa04110&#39;) 12.12 pathview from pathview package clusterProfiler users can also use pathview from the pathview(Luo and Brouwer 2013) to visualize KEGG pathway. The following example illustrate how to visualize “hsa04110” pathway, which was enriched in our previous analysis. library(&quot;pathview&quot;) hsa04110 &lt;- pathview(gene.data = geneList, pathway.id = &quot;hsa04110&quot;, species = &quot;hsa&quot;, limit = list(gene=max(abs(geneList)), cpd=1)) For further information, please refer to the vignette of pathview(Luo and Brouwer 2013).

The ‘kegg’ is the primary ID used in KEGG database. The data source of KEGG was from NCBI. A rule of thumb for the ‘kegg’ ID is entrezgene ID for eukaryote species and Locus ID for prokaryotes. Many prokaryote species don’t have entrezgene ID available. For example we can check the gene information of ece:Z5100 in http://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?ece:Z5100, which have NCBI-ProteinID and UnitProt links in the Other DBs Entry, but not NCBI-GeneID. If we try to convert Z5100 to ncbi-geneid, bitr_kegg will throw error of ncbi-geneid is not supported. bitr_kegg(&quot;Z5100&quot;, fromType=&quot;kegg&quot;, toType=&#39;ncbi-geneid&#39;, organism=&#39;ece&#39;) ## Error in KEGG_convert(fromType, toType, organism) : ## ncbi-geneid is not supported for ece ...

If readable = TRUE, all the gene IDs will be translated to gene symbols. The readable parameter is not available for enrichment analysis of KEGG or using user’s own annotation. KEGG analysis using enrichKEGG and gseKEGG, internally query annotation information from KEEGG database and thus support all species if it is available in the KEGG database. However, KEGG database doesn’t provide gene ID to symbol mapping information. For analysis using user’s own annotation data, we even don’t know what species is in analyzed. Translating gene IDs to gene symbols is partly supported using the setReadable function if and only if there is an OrgDb available. library(org.Hs.eg.db) library(clusterProfiler) data(geneList, package=&quot;DOSE&quot;) de &lt;- names(geneList)[1:100] x &lt;- enrichKEGG(de) ## The geneID column is ENTREZID head(x, 3) ## ID Description GeneRatio BgRatio ## hsa04110 hsa04110 Cell cycle 8/48 124/7932 ## hsa04218 hsa04218 Cellular senescence 7/48 160/7932 ## hsa04114 hsa04114 Oocyte meiosis 6/48 128/7932 ## pvalue p.adjust qvalue ## hsa04110 6.356283e-07 7.182599e-05 6.490099e-05 ## hsa04218 4.377944e-05 2.473538e-03 2.235055e-03 ## hsa04114 1.105828e-04 4.165285e-03 3.763695e-03 ## geneID Count ## hsa04110 8318/991/9133/890/983/4085/7272/1111 8 ## hsa04218 2305/4605/9133/890/983/51806/1111 7 ## hsa04114 991/9133/983/4085/51806/6790 6 y &lt;- setReadable(x, OrgDb = org.Hs.eg.db, keyType=&quot;ENTREZID&quot;) ## The geneID column is translated to symbol head(y, 3) ## ID Description GeneRatio BgRatio ## hsa04110 hsa04110 Cell cycle 8/48 124/7932 ## hsa04218 hsa04218 Cellular senescence 7/48 160/7932 ## hsa04114 hsa04114 Oocyte meiosis 6/48 128/7932 ## pvalue p.adjust qvalue ## hsa04110 6.356283e-07 7.182599e-05 6.490099e-05 ## hsa04218 4.377944e-05 2.473538e-03 2.235055e-03 ## hsa04114 1.105828e-04 4.165285e-03 3.763695e-03 ## geneID ## hsa04110 CDC45/CDC20/CCNB2/CCNA2/CDK1/MAD2L1/TTK/CHEK1 ## hsa04218 FOXM1/MYBL2/CCNB2/CCNA2/CDK1/CALML5/CHEK1 ## hsa04114 CDC20/CCNB2/CDK1/MAD2L1/CALML5/AURKA ## Count ## hsa04110 8 ## hsa04218 7 ## hsa04114 6 For those functions that internally support readable parameter, user can also use setReadable for translating gene IDs.
